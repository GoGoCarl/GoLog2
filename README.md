Time Stash
=======
*Saves your time, saves you time.*

Time Stash (working name) is a mobile application framework designed to
make time-logging fast and easy for any time-tracking system.

The framework provides a front-end fitting almost any time-tracking
system that follows the pattern below:

* Users create projects to organize works being tracked.
* Users create tasks within projects to work against.
* Date, hours, and notes are collected for time log information.

Given this, the framework is able to:

* Log time entries.
* Save templates of time entries that can be used for future logs.
* Use a timer to track how long a task has taken, then log their time
  accordingly.
* View, edit, and delete existing time entries.

The result will be mobile applications built atop the framework
implementing the details for a given time-tracking system.
